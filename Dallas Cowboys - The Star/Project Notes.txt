Sir/Ma'am,

The Dallas Cowboys asked the University of North Texas to help predict real world attendance and concession sales at The Star in Frisco, Texas.
I was selected by to be a part of a three person data science team by the UNT Advanced Data Analytics staff and chairman.

I personally handled data cleaning and the creation of the Tableau dashboard.
